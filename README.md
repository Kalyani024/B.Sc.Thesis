This project explores drug encapsulation using PLGA-PEG-PLGA copolymers to improve drug stability and delivery. Using molecular dynamic simulations, it evaluates drug-polymer interactions, binding affinities, and encapsulation efficiency, aiming to enhance targeted drug delivery systems for cancer therapy.
